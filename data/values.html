<p>GitLab‚Äôs six core values are
<a href="#collaboration"><strong>ü§ù Collaboration</strong></a>,
<a href="#results"><strong>üìà Results for Customers</strong></a>,
<a href="#efficiency"><strong>‚è±Ô∏è Efficiency</strong></a>,

<a href="#iteration"><strong>üë£ Iteration</strong></a>, and
<a href="#transparency"><strong>üëÅÔ∏è Transparency</strong></a>,
and together they spell the <strong>CREDIT</strong> we give each other by assuming
good intent. We react to them <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#values-emoji">with values

actionable below.</p>

</p>
<p>We take inspiration from other companies, and we always go for the <a href="#boring-solutions">boring solutions</a>. Our CEO, Sid Sijbrandij, has <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/history/#value-origin-stories">shared the origin</a> of each of the CREDIT values, but
just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our values and strive to make them better.
GitLab values are a living document.
In many instances, they have been documented, refined, and revised based on lessons learned (and scars earned) in the course of doing business.</p>
<p>We used to have more values, but it was difficult to remember them all. In response, we condensed them, created an acronym (CREDIT), and listed operating principles to guide behavior.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to suggest improvements. Please assign MRs to update these values to our CEO Sid and @mention him in Slack if you work at GitLab Inc. or <a href="https://twitter.com/sytses">on Twitter</a> if you don‚Äôt.</p>

<h2 id="collaboration">ü§ù Collaboration<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#collaboration" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p>To achieve results, team members must work together effectively. At GitLab, helping others is a priority, even when it is not immediately related to the goals that you are trying to achieve.
Similarly, you can rely on others for help and advice‚Äîin fact, you‚Äôre expected to do so.
Anyone can chime in on any subject, including people who don‚Äôt work at GitLab.
The person who‚Äôs responsible for the work decides how to do it,
but they should always take each suggestion seriously and try to respond and explain why it may or may not have been implemented.</p>
<h5 id="kindness">Kindness<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#kindness" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We value caring for others.
Demonstrating we care for people provides an effective framework for challenging directly and delivering feedback.
Kindness doesn‚Äôt mean holding back on feedback or avoiding disagreements, these are crucial to professional growth and getting results for customers.
Kindness means you make a separation between the work and the person, you can criticize someone‚Äôs work but still be respectful to the person.
Give as much positive feedback as you can, and do it in a public way.</p>
<h5 id="share">Share<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#share" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>There are aspects of GitLab culture, such as intentional transparency, that are unintuitive to outsiders and new team members.
Be willing to invest in people and engage in open dialogue.
For example, consider making private issues public wherever possible so that we can all learn from the experience. Don‚Äôt be afraid of judgement or scrutiny when sharing publicly, we all understand <a href="#its-impossible-to-know-everything">it‚Äôs impossible to know everything</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone can <strong>remind</strong> anyone in the company about our values.
If there is a disagreement about the interpretations, the discussion can be escalated to more people within the company without repercussions.</p>
<p>Share problems you run into, ask for help, be forthcoming with information and <strong>speak up</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="negative-feedback-is-1-1">Negative feedback is 1-1<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#negative-feedback-is-1-1" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Give negative feedback in the smallest setting possible.
One-on-one video calls are preferred.</p>
<p>Negative <em>feedback</em> is distinct from negativity and disagreement. If there is no direct feedback involved, strive to discuss disagreement <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#use-public-channels">in a public channel</a>, respectfully and <a href="#transparency">transparently</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://youtu.be/7kMQj4O4ZGU">GitLab Unfiltered interview on values</a>, GitLab co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij offers the following context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We deal with negative all the time at GitLab. If it‚Äôs not a problem, then why are we discussing it? We deal with negativity a lot, and that‚Äôs also part of our ambition.</p>
<p>If you want to get better, you talk about what you can improve. We‚Äôre allowed to publicly discuss negative things; we‚Äôre not allowed to give negative feedback in a large setting if it could be feasibly administered in a smaller setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Negative feedback can be given in a group setting if it‚Äôs to someone higher in the management chain. This shows that no one is above feedback. GitLab co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij and former CTO Eric Johnson discuss this in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpmFWL5Us8">GitLab Unfiltered video</a>.</p>
<h5 id="provide-feedback-in-a-timely-manner">Provide feedback in a timely manner<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#provide-feedback-in-a-timely-manner" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We want to solve problems while they are <strong>small</strong>.
If you are unhappy with anything (your duties, your colleague, your boss, your salary, your location, your computer), please voice your concerns rather than keeping them to yourself. If you need to escalate beyond your manager, you could consider speaking to your <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/skip-levels/#purpose-and-benefits-of-skip-levels">skip-level</a>, a more senior person, or a <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/job-families/people-group/people-business-partner/">people business partner</a>.</p>
<h5 id="say-thanks">Say thanks<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#say-thanks" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Recognize the people that helped you publicly, for example in our <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/employment-branding/people-communications/">#thanks chat channel</a>.</p>
<p>When publicly thanking, it‚Äôs important to recognize the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Showing thanks in as large a setting as possible (company-wide) at a company as large as ours is the exception instead of the norm, it takes some getting used to.</li>
<li>Being thanked at the company level for what you view as a relatively small or minuscule contribution can feel awkward.</li>
<li>Thanking a person in #thanks should be done sincerely and summarize why you are thankful so the person on the receiving end can easily understand why they are being thanked. Even while <a href="#assume-positive-intent">assuming positive intent</a>, not all folks are comfortable with public praise. Help this person understand how they went above and beyond and why you felt it was important for the team member to be recognized.</li>
<li>There are a number of good ways and places to say thanks. We shouldn‚Äôt limit saying thanks to just the <code>#thanks</code> channel.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="give-feedback-effectively">Give feedback effectively<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#give-feedback-effectively" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Giving feedback is challenging, but it‚Äôs important to deliver it effectively.
When providing feedback, always make it about the work itself;
focus on the business impact and not the person.
Make sure to provide at least one clear and recent example.
If a person is going through a hard time in their personal life, then take that into account.
An example of giving positive feedback is our <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/employment-branding/people-communications/">thanks chat channel</a>.
For managers, it‚Äôs important to realize that team members react to a negative incident with their managers <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/03/the-delicate-art-of-giving-fee">six times more strongly</a> than they do to a positive one.
Keeping that in mind, if an error is so inconsequential that the value gained from providing criticism is low, it might make sense to keep that feedback to yourself.
In the situations where negative feedback must be given, focus on the purpose for that feedback: to improve the team member‚Äôs performance going forward.
Give recognition generously, in the open, and often to <a href="https://humanresources.report/Resources/Whitepapers/3a779920-0dae-4fd5-95bf-58a1fc0c623d_How%20do%20I%20recognize%20thee,%20let%20me%20count%20the%20ways.PDF">generate more engagement</a> from your team.</p>
<h5 id="get-to-know-each-other">Get to know each other<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#get-to-know-each-other" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We use a lot of <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/effective-communication/">text-based communication</a>, and if you know the person behind the text, it will be easier to prevent conflicts.
So we encourage people to get to know each other on a personal level through <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/">informal communication</a>, for example, virtual <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#coffee-chats">coffee chats</a>, and during <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/events/gitlab-contribute/">GitLab Contribute</a>.</p>
<h5 id="reach-across-company-departments">Reach across company departments<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#reach-across-company-departments" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>While it‚Äôs wise to seek advice from experts within your function, we encourage GitLab team members to do the same across departments. This enables the company to iterate more quickly, embrace the understanding that everyone can contribute and include more diverse perspectives when possible.</p>
<h5 id="dont-pull-rank">Don‚Äôt pull rank<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#dont-pull-rank" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>If you have to remind someone of the position you have in the company, you‚Äôre doing something wrong.
People already know <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#making-decisions">our decision-making process</a>.
Explain why you‚Äôre making the decision, and respect everyone irrespective of their function.
This includes using the rank of another person - <a href="https://twitter.com/EmiliejayG/status/1198731054162432000">including the CEO</a> - to sell an idea or decision.</p>
<h5 id="assume-positive-intent">Assume positive intent<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#assume-positive-intent" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We naturally have a double standard when it comes to the actions of others.
We blame circumstances for our own mistakes, but individuals for theirs.
This double standard is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error">Fundamental Attribution Error</a>.
In order to mitigate this bias, you should always <a href="https://www.collaborativeway.com/general/a-ceos-advice-assume-positive-intent/">assume positive intent</a> in your interactions with others, respecting their expertise and giving them grace in the face of what you might perceive as mistakes.</p>
<p>When <a href="#disagree-commit-and-disagree">disagreeing</a>, folks sometimes argue against the weakest points of an argument, or an imaginary argument (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">‚Äústraw man‚Äù</a>). Assume the points are presented in good faith, and instead try to argue against the strongest version of your opponent‚Äôs position. We call this arguing against a ‚Äústeel‚Äù position, instead of a ‚Äústraw‚Äù one. This concept is borrowed from <a href="https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man">argue the ‚Äústeel man‚Äù</a> technique.</p>
<p>A ‚Äústeel‚Äù position should be against the absolute most effective version of your opponent‚Äôs position ‚Äî potentially even more compelling than the one they presented. A good ‚Äústeel‚Äù position is one where the other person feels you‚Äôve represented their position well, even if they still disagree with your assumptions or conclusion.</p>
<h5 id="address-behavior-but-dont-label-people">Address behavior, but don‚Äôt label people<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#address-behavior-but-dont-label-people" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>There is a lot of good in <a href="http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/10/the_no_asshole_.html">this article</a> about not wanting jerks on our team, but we believe that <strong>jerk</strong> is a label for behavior rather than an inherent classification of a person.  We avoid classifications.</p>
<h5 id="say-sorry">Say sorry<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#say-sorry" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>If you made a mistake, apologize as soon as possible.
Saying sorry is not a sign of weakness but one of strength.
The people that do the most work will likely make the most mistakes.
Additionally, when we share our mistakes and bring attention to them, others can learn from us, and the same mistake is less likely to be repeated by someone else.
Mistakes can include when you have not been kind to someone. In order to reinforce our values, it is important, and takes more courage, to apologize publicly when you have been unkind publicly (e.g., when you have said something unkind or unprofessional to an individual or group in a Slack channel).</p>
<h5 id="no-ego">No ego<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#no-ego" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Don‚Äôt defend a point to win an argument or double-down on a mistake.
You are not your work; you don‚Äôt have to defend your point.
You do have to search for the right answer with help from others.</p>
<p>In a GitLab Unfiltered <a href="https://youtu.be/n9Gfe9p1tmA">interview</a>, GitLab Head of Remote Darren M. adds context on this operating principle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many organizations, there‚Äôs a subtle, low-level, persistent pressure to continually prove your worth.
And I believe that this fuels imposter syndrome and wreaks havoc on <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/">mental health</a>.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs so troubling to me is how often perception is reality.
In other words, those who have mastered the art of being perceived as elite reap benefits, though this has nothing to do with actual results.</p>
<p>At GitLab, ‚Äúno ego‚Äù means that we foster and support an environment where results matter, and you‚Äôre given agency to approach your work in the way that makes sense to you.
Instead of judging people for not approaching work in an agreed-upon way, ‚Äúno ego‚Äù encourages people to glean inspiration from watching others approach work in new and different ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being no ego is a standard we hold ourselves as people to but is not one that applies to GitLab as a company or product.
We want to celebrate and highlight GitLab‚Äôs accomplishments, including being <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/">one of the largest all-remote companies</a>.
This doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt recognize our mistakes, including how we handled <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/10/10/update-free-software-and-telemetry/">telemetry</a>.</p>
<h5 id="see-others-succeed">See others succeed<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#see-others-succeed" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>A candidate who has talked to a lot of people inside GitLab said that, compared to other companies, one thing stood out the most: everyone here mentioned wanting to see each other succeed.</p>
<h5 id="dont-let-each-other-fail">Don‚Äôt let each other fail<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#dont-let-each-other-fail" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Keep an eye out for others who may be struggling or stuck.
If you see someone who needs help, reach out and assist. This might involve offering to <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/08/20/agile-pairing-sessions/">pair program</a> or setting up a sync brainstorming session. The goal is to connect them with someone else who can provide expertise or assistance.
We are a team, so we succeed and shine together by supporting each other!</p>
<h5 id="people-are-not-their-work">People are not their work<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#people-are-not-their-work" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Always make suggestions about examples of work, not the person.
Say ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt respond to my feedback about the design‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúYou never listen‚Äù.
And, when receiving feedback, keep in mind that feedback is the best way to improve, and that others giving you feedback want to see you succeed.</p>
<h5 id="do-it-yourself">Do it yourself<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#do-it-yourself" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Our collaboration value is about helping each other when we have questions, need critique, or need help.
No need to brainstorm, wait for consensus, or <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/collaboration-is-the-enemy-of-innovation.html">do with two what you can do yourself</a>. The Bolt Handbook refers to this as the <a href="https://conscious.org/how-a-founders-mentality-encourages-employee-recognition/">Founder Mentality</a>, where all team members should approach the problem as if they own the company.</p>
<h5 id="blameless-problem-solving">Blameless problem solving<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#blameless-problem-solving" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Investigate mistakes in a way that focuses on the situational aspects of a failure‚Äôs mechanism and the decision-making process that led to the failure, rather than cast blame on a person or team.
We hold blameless <a href="https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/">root cause analyses</a> and <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/">retrospectives</a> for stakeholders to speak up without fear of punishment or retribution.</p>
<h5 id="short-toes">Short toes<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#short-toes" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>People joining the company frequently say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to step on anyone‚Äôs toes.‚Äù
At GitLab, we should be more accepting of people taking initiative in trying to improve things.
As companies grow, their speed of decision-making goes down since there are more people involved.
We should counteract that by having short toes and feeling comfortable letting others contribute to our domain.
For example, pointed, respectful feedback to a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests/24447">proposal</a> by GitLab‚Äôs CEO led to his own merge request being closed. However, it is not required to respond to comments.</p>
<h5 id="its-impossible-to-know-everything">It‚Äôs impossible to know everything<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#its-impossible-to-know-everything" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We know we must rely on others for the expertise they have that we don‚Äôt.
It‚Äôs OK to admit you don‚Äôt know something and to ask for help, even if doing so makes you feel vulnerable.
It is never too late to ask a question, and by doing so, you can get the information you need to produce results and to strengthen your own skills as well as GitLab as a whole.
After your question is answered, <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#how-we-use-the-guide-every-day">please document the answer so that it can be shared</a>.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt display surprise when people say they don‚Äôt know something, as it is important that everyone feels comfortable saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù
(As inspired by <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules">Recurse</a>.)</p>
<h5 id="collaboration-is-not-consensus">Collaboration is not consensus<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#collaboration-is-not-consensus" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>When collaborating, it is always important to stay above radar and work <a href="#transparency">transparently</a>, but collaboration is <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#making-decisions">not consensus</a> and disagreement is part of collaboration.
You don‚Äôt need to ask people for their input, and they shouldn‚Äôt ask you ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you ask me?‚Äù
You don‚Äôt have to wait for people to provide input, if you did ask them.
You don‚Äôt need to have everyone agreeing to the same thing - they can <a href="#disagree-commit-and-disagree">disagree, commit, and disagree</a>. <a href="#make-two-way-door-decisions">Two-way doors decisions</a> can be reversed as part of <a href="#disagree-commit-and-disagree">disagree, commit, and disagree</a>, while one-way door decisions benefit from more input. Recognize these reversible two-way door decisions for when less input is required to iterate faster.
We believe in permissionless innovation‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to involve people, but everyone can contribute.
This is core to how we <a href="#iteration">iterate</a>, since we want smaller teams moving quickly rather than large teams achieving consensus slowly.</p>
<h5 id="collaboration-competency">Collaboration Competency<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#collaboration-competency" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p><a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/">Competencies</a> are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn.
We demonstrate collaboration when we take action to help others and include other‚Äôs (both internal and external) input (both help and feedback) to achieve the best possible outcome.</p>

Setting ambitious, measurable goals enables us to best deliver customer results.  We agree in writing on measurable goals. Within the company we use <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/okrs/">OKRs</a> to stay accountable. We have and report against <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/kpis/">KPIs</a> with guiding targets.</p>
<h5 id="understand-our-customers">Understand our customers<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#understand-our-customers" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>All GitLab team members should understand our customers‚Äô needs, issues, and value propositions. We understand how they use GitLab and what they need from a platform in order to meet their goals. Internally facing teams consider the impact of their work as it pertains indirectly to GitLab‚Äôs customers.</p>
<p>We better understand customers and their needs through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing public facing GitLab issues from our customers and users</li>
<li><a href="#dogfooding">Dogfooding</a> our product to understand the user experience</li>
<li>Reading customer stories from Marketing and Sales</li>
<li>Attending Customer fireside chats</li>
<li>Learning feedback from our customers and users on product features and roadmap</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="co-create">Co-create<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#co-create" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We create together with our customers. There is an open dialogue between GitLab and our customers so that we can better identify what they need. As a result of building a solution for them, we can also bring that solution to the world.</p>
<h5 id="keep-end-users-in-sight">Keep end users in sight<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#keep-end-users-in-sight" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Our focus is to increase customer results. At GitLab, one way to drive customer results is through platform enhancements that drive the most value for direct users. This requires being aware of <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanfalor/status/1182647229414166528?s=12">the Concur effect</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/">Arvind Narayanan</a>, a Princeton Professor, described his frustration with Blackboard in a viral Tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has every feature ever dreamed up. But like anything designed by a committee, the interface is incoherent and any task requires at least fifteen clicks (and that‚Äôs if you even remember the correct sequence the first time).</p>
<p>Software companies can be breathtakingly clueless when there‚Äôs a layer of indirection between them and their users. Everyone who‚Äôs suffered through Blackboard will have the same reaction to this: try having less functionality!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ryanfalor">Ryan Falor</a> followed up on Narayanan‚Äôs tweet with his definition of the Concur Effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>decision makers are not direct users</li>
<li>features are overwhelming and disjointed</li>
<li>user experience gets worse over time</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>See <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21224209">the Hacker News discussion</a> for a specific UX example.</p>
<p>At GitLab, we want to drive customer results through focusing on platform enhancements that drive the most value for direct users.</p>
<p><strong>Customer results are more important</strong> than:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What we plan to make</strong>. If we focus only on our own plans, we would have only GitLab.com and no self-managed delivery of GitLab. This does not mean that we will agree to every feature request, but we won‚Äôt let existing plans be an obstacle to working on what will drive the most customer value.</li>
<li><strong>Large customer requests</strong>. Catering to requests from large customers leads to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">innovator‚Äôs dilemma</a>, we need to also focus on results for small and future customers.</li>
<li><strong>Our existing scope</strong>. For example, when customers asked for better integrations and complained about integration costs and effort, we responded by expanding our scope to create a <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/single-application/">single application</a> for the DevOps lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Our assumptions</strong>. Every company works differently, so we can‚Äôt assume that what works well for us will support our customers‚Äô needs. When we have an idea, we must directly validate our assumptions with multiple customers to ensure we create scalable, highly relevant solutions.</li>
<li><strong>What we control</strong>. We should take responsibility for what the <strong>customer experiences</strong>, even when it isn‚Äôt entirely in our control. We aim to treat every customer-managed instance downtime as a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/commit/8b7857c1f7c59c53e4a9c0d6008830459d817497">$1M a day problem</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="measure-impact-not-activity">Measure impact, not activity<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#measure-impact-not-activity" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We care about what you achieve: the code you shipped, the needle you moved, the user you made happy, and the team member you helped. Someone who took the afternoon off shouldn‚Äôt feel like they did something wrong, unless it negatively impacted a goal or result they were responsible for. You don‚Äôt have to defend how you spend your day if you are performing and delivering against expectations. We trust team members to do the right thing instead of having rigid rules. We trust team members to show up and do their best work. Do not incite competition by proclaiming how many hours you worked yesterday. If you are working too many hours, talk to your manager to discuss solutions.</p>
<h5 id="dogfooding">Dogfooding<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#dogfooding" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">use our own product</a> in the way our users do to surface improvements that will lead to better <a href="#customer-results">customer results</a>. GitLab is a DevSecOps Platform that can be used by people throughout the business. This is how we use it within GitLab. For example, we use our OKR functionality company-wide to inform product enhancements and for team members to have a great understanding of the customer experience. We also dogfood in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our development organization uses GitLab.com to manage the DevOps lifecycle of GitLab itself.</li>
<li>All team members use GitLab to collaborate on this handbook.</li>
<li>We capture content and processes in Git repos and manage them with GitLab.</li>
</ol>
<p>When something breaks, doesn‚Äôt work well, or needs improvement, we are more likely to notice it internally and address it before it impacts our larger community.</p>
<h5 id="give-agency">Give agency<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#give-agency" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We give people agency to focus on what they think is most beneficial. If a meeting doesn‚Äôt seem interesting and someone‚Äôs active participation is not critical to the outcome of the meeting, they can always opt to not attend, or during a video call they can work on other things if they want. Staying in the call may still make sense even if you are working on other tasks, so other peers can ping you and get fast answers when needed. This is particularly useful in multi-purpose meetings where you may be involved for just a few minutes.</p>
<h5 id="challenger-mindset">Challenger mindset<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#challenger-mindset" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Challenging the status quo can lead to remarkable results - we must never stop. A <a href="https://books.forbes.com/author-articles/whats-a-challenger-mindset-and-why-adopt-it-in-2021/">challenger mindset</a> requires that we continually ask ourselves bold, difficult questions about our business the problems we solve while resisting complacency. To succeed we must innovate and delight our customers with the value of the products we build. A challenger mindset requires a relentless persuit of excellence - we must be <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#tenacity">tenacious</a>. Each win for our customers builds reputational capital we can use to earn the trust of prospects in a competitive market. While competition is a feature of capitalism internally as GitLab team members we must focus our efforts inwardly on achieving our very best results for customers to win market share.</p>
<h5 id="growth-mindset">Growth mindset<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#growth-mindset" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>You don‚Äôt always get results and this will lead to criticism from yourself and/or others. We believe our talents can be developed through hard work, targeted training, learning from others, on-the-job experience, and receiving input from others. It is in our DNA as a company and individuals to look for opportunity, stay humble, and never settle. We try to hire people based on <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means">their trajectory, not their pedigree</a>. We also strive to foster a culture of curiosity and continuous learning where team members are provided and proactively seek out opportunities to grow themselves and their careers. We believe that with the right expectations and direction, people can grow to take on new challenges and surpass expectations.</p>
<h5 id="cross-functional-optimization">Cross-functional optimization<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#cross-functional-optimization" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Our definition of cross-functional optimization is that you do what is best for the organization as a whole. Don‚Äôt optimize for the goals of your team when it negatively impacts the goals of other teams, our users, and/or the company. Those goals are also your problem and your job. For example, you may have set a non-urgent functional milestone that is supposed to land at the end of the quarter. If delivering within the last week requires engagement from <a href="https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/go-to-market/">the GTM teams</a>, the right decision may be to push your own team‚Äôs target by a week to reduce the ask for the GTM team as the GTM focuses on meeting its revenue objectives.</p>
<p>In the context of <a href="#collaboration">collaboration</a>, if anyone is blocked by you on a question, your approval, or a merge request review, you should prioritize unblocking them, either directly or through helping them find someone else who can.</p>
<h5 id="embrace-tenacity">Embrace Tenacity<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#embrace-tenacity" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We refer to this as ‚Äúpersistence of purpose‚Äù. As talked about in <a href="https://www.learntoinfluence.com/developing-tenacity-when-facing-opposition/">The Influence Blog</a>, tenacity is the ability to display commitment to what you believe in. You keep picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and quickly get going again having learned a little more. We value the ability to maintain focus and motivation when work is tough and asking for help when needed.</p>
<h5 id="have-ownership--accountability">Have Ownership &amp; Accountability<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#have-ownership--accountability" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We expect team members to complete tasks that they are assigned. You are responsible for executing with attention to detail, connecting the dots across the organization and anticipating and solving problems. As an owner, you are responsible for overcoming challenges, not suppliers or other team members. Take initiative and proactively inform stakeholders when there is something you might not be able to solve.</p>
<h5 id="sense-of-urgency">Sense of urgency<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#sense-of-urgency" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Time gained or lost has compounding effects. Try to get the results as fast as possible, but without compromising our other values and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication">ways we communicate</a>, so the compounding of results can begin and we can focus on the next improvement.</p>
<h5 id="operate-with-a-bias-for-action">Operate with a bias for action<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#operate-with-a-bias-for-action" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>It‚Äôs important that we keep our focus on action, and don‚Äôt fall into the trap of analysis paralysis or sticking to a slow, quiet path without risk. Decisions should be thoughtful, but delivering fast results requires the fearless acceptance of occasionally making mistakes; our bias for action also allows us to course correct quickly. Try to get results as fast as possible, but without compromising our other values and ways of working</p>
<h5 id="disagree-commit-and-advocate">Disagree, commit, and advocate<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#disagree-commit-and-advocate" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>When a decision is in place, we expect people to commit to executing it. Any past decisions and guidelines are open to questioning as long as you act in accordance with them until they are changed. This is <a href="https://ryanestis.com/leadership/disagree-and-commit-to-get-things-done/">a common principle</a>.
Every decision can be changed;
our <a href="https://youtu.be/4BIsON95fl8?t=2034">best decision was one that changed an earlier one</a>.
In a manager-report relationship, usually the report is the <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/">Directly Responsible Individuals</a> (DRI).
The manager may disagree with the final decision, but they still commit to the decision of the DRI.</p>
<p>In a group setting, participants may disagree with a proposal but not articulate their views for one reason or another. Sometimes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene_paradox">many or all individuals may disagree yet choose not to speak up</a>, because no one believes they would get agreement from the group. As a result, everyone loses out on their feedback. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissent">Dissent</a> is expression of that disagreement. However, it can be difficult and even socially expensive.
Expression of feedback is a way for everyone to grow and learn, and is <a href="https://hbr.org/tip/2018/04/good-feedback-is-based-on-facts-not-your-opinion">based on facts rather than opinions</a>. Share your perspective, rather than agreeing simply to avoid conflict or to go along with everyone else.</p>
<p>When you want to reopen the conversation on something, show that your argument is informed by previous conversations and <a href="#assume-positive-intent">assume the decision was made with the best intent</a>.
You have to achieve results on every decision while it stands, even when you are trying to have it changed.
You should communicate with the <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/">DRI</a> who can change the decision instead of someone who can‚Äôt.</p>
<h5 id="escalate-to-unblock">Escalate to unblock<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#escalate-to-unblock" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>If there is a disagreement and you can‚Äôt move forward because of it, agree to escalate and escalate to one or both of your managers. Early escalation, delivered with context of the challenge, enables managers to function as an unblocker.</p>
<h5 id="results-competency">Results Competency<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#results-competency" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>

<h2 id="efficiency">‚è±Ô∏è Efficiency<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#efficiency" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p>At GitLab, efficiency means producing <a href="#results">results</a> without wasting materials, time, or energy. We optimize solutions globally for the broader GitLab community over one person or a small group. Focus on efficiency should be global in nature, not just local to a given function. Global efficiency could include efficiency with customers, candidates, and contributors as well. It is easy to prioritize consistency over efficiency because consistency is often more efficient initially and makes managing processes more efficient. We should slow down when optimizing for consistency. Taking a company-wide lens when evaluating changes will help ensure that new processes will improve efficiency for GitLab as a whole and be the best decision for the company as a whole.</p>
<p>When we work internally with other team members, we leverage GitLab‚Äôs unique working practices and operating principles to achieve top efficiency. We do not expect people outside of GitLab to conform to GitLab‚Äôs ways of working, and we will make accommodations to work effectively with them. For example, we may collaborate heavily in-person and not default to async communications.</p>
<h5 id="only-healthy-constraints">Only Healthy Constraints<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#only-healthy-constraints" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Most companies regress to the mean and slow down over time. While some changes are required as a company grows and matures, not all change is inevitable or should be allowed to passively happen. As GitLab grows, we are conscious of how we operate and how it enables our ability to continue to operate with the agility of a <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/still-a-startup/">startup</a>. We try to limit ourselves to <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/only-healthy-constraints/">healthy constraints</a>.</p>
<h5 id="write-things-down">Write things down<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#write-things-down" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We document everything: in the handbook, in meeting notes, in issues.
We do that because ‚Äú<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-The-faintest-pencil-is-better-than-the-sharpest-memory-mean">the faintest pencil is better than the sharpest memory</a>.‚Äù
It is far more efficient to read a document at your convenience than to have to ask and explain. Having something in version control also lets everyone contribute suggestions to improve it.</p>
<h5 id="boring-solutions">Boring solutions<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#boring-solutions" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Use the simplest and most boring solution for a problem, and remember that <a href="http://boringtechnology.club/">‚Äúboring‚Äù</a> should <a href="http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">not be conflated with ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äútechnical debt.‚Äù</a>
The speed of innovation for our organization and product is constrained by the total complexity we have added so far, so every little reduction in complexity helps.
Don‚Äôt pick an interesting technology just to make your work more fun;
using established, popular tech will ensure a more stable and more familiar experience for you and other contributors.</p>
<p>Make a conscious effort to <strong>recognize</strong> the constraints of others within the team.
For example, sales is hard because you are dependent on another organization, and development is hard because you have to preserve the ability to quickly improve the product in the future.</p>
<h5 id="self-service-and-self-learning">Self-service and self-learning<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#self-service-and-self-learning" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Team members should first <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/self-service/">search for their own answers</a> and, if an answer is not readily found or the answer is not clear, ask in public as we all should have a <a href="#low-level-of-shame">low level of shame</a>. <a href="#write-things-down">Write down any new information discovered</a> and pay it forward so that those coming after will have better efficiency built on top of practicing collaboration, inclusion, and documenting the results.</p>
<p>Team members have more room to grow themselves when they are able to self-service and self-learn.</p>
<h5 id="efficiency-for-the-right-group">Efficiency for the right group<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#efficiency-for-the-right-group" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Optimize solutions globally for the broader GitLab community. As an example, it may be best to discard a renewal process that requires thousands of customers to each spend two hours in favor of one that only takes sixty seconds, even when it may make a monthly report less efficient internally! In a decision, ask yourself ‚ÄúFor whom does this need to be most efficient?‚Äù Quite often, the answer may be your users, contributors, customers, or team members that are dependent upon your decision.</p>
<h5 id="be-respectful-of-others-time">Be respectful of others‚Äô time<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#be-respectful-of-others-time" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Consider the time investment you are asking others to make with meetings and a permission process. Try to avoid meetings, and if one is necessary, try to make attendance optional for as many people as possible. Any meeting should have an agenda linked from the invite, and you should document the outcome. Instead of having people ask permission, trust their judgment and offer a consultation process if they have questions.</p>
<h5 id="spend-company-money-like-its-your-own">Spend company money like it‚Äôs your own<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#spend-company-money-like-its-your-own" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Every dollar we spend will have to be earned back. Be as frugal with company money as you are with your own. In saying this, we ask team members to weigh the cost of purchases against the value that they will bring to the company.</p>
<p>Consider the degree to which a purchase increases your ability to better accomplish your work and achieve business <a href="#results">results</a> relative to cost. Lowering overhead reduces the cost to operate the business and lets us shift spend toward other priority areas.</p>
<p>We have <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money/#guidelines">guidelines</a> around this operating principle to help team members better understand our expensing process and expectations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.jobs/principles">Amazon states it best</a> with: ‚ÄúAccomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.‚Äù</p>
<h5 id="short-verbal-answers">Short verbal answers<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#short-verbal-answers" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>

<h5 id="keep-broadcasts-short">Keep broadcasts short<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#keep-broadcasts-short" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Keep one-to-many written communication short, as mentioned in <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/bad-writing-is-destroying-your-companys-productivity">this HBR study</a>: ‚ÄúA majority say that what they read is frequently ineffective because it‚Äôs too long, poorly organized, unclear, filled with jargon, and imprecise.‚Äù</p>
<h5 id="managers-of-one">Managers of one<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#managers-of-one" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We want each team member to be <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#managers-of-one">a manager of one</a> who doesn‚Äôt need daily check-ins to achieve their goals. Team members are given the freedom to own projects and initiatives and are trusted to see them through to a successful end.</p>
<p>When team members are managers of one they can have an increased work/life balance, because they are more empowered to make decisions around how they allocate their time throughout each day.</p>
<h5 id="freedom-and-responsibility-over-rigidity">Freedom and responsibility over rigidity<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#freedom-and-responsibility-over-rigidity" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>When possible, we give people the responsibility to make a decision and hold them accountable for that, instead of imposing rules and approval processes. You should have clear objectives and the freedom to work on them as you see fit. Freedom and responsibility are more efficient than rigidly following a process, <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/structure/#product-groups">or creating interdependencies</a>, because they enable faster decision velocity and higher rates of <a href="#iteration">iteration</a>.</p>
<p>When team members have freedom and responsibility over rigidity, they have more room to help others.</p>
<h5 id="accept-mistakes">Accept mistakes<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#accept-mistakes" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Not every problem should lead to a new process to prevent them. Additional processes make all actions more inefficient; a mistake only affects one. Once you have accepted the mistake, learn from it. When team members are free to accept mistakes, they can take more calculated risks.</p>

<p>We value constant improvement by iterating quickly, month after month. If a task is not the <a href="#iteration">smallest viable and valuable thing</a>, cut the scope.</p>
<h5 id="embrace-change">Embrace change<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#embrace-change" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Adoption of features, user requirements, and the competitive landscape change frequently and rapidly. The most successful companies adapt their roadmap and their organization quickly to keep pace. One of the things that makes this challenging is the impact on our team. People may need to change teams, subject matter, or even who manages them. This can rightly feel disruptive. If we coach ourselves to embrace the positive aspects of change, such as increased opportunity and new things to learn, we can move faster as a company and increase our odds of success. It is important to <a href="#always-iterate-deliberately">hold management accountable for being deliberate</a>.</p>

<h2 id="diversity-inclusion">üåê Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Belonging<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#diversity-inclusion" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p>Diversity, inclusion and belonging are fundamental to the success of GitLab. We aim to make a significant impact in our efforts to foster an environment where everyone can thrive. We are designing a multidimensional approach to ensure that GitLab is a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute. We actively chose to <a href="https://www.russellreynolds.com/en/insights/reports-surveys/diversity-and-inclusion-gamechangers">build and institutionalize</a> a culture that is <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/inclusion/">inclusive</a> and supports all team members equally in the process of achieving their professional goals. We hire globally and encourage hiring in a diverse set of countries. We work to make everyone feel welcome and to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities and nationalities in our community and company. For example, we celebrate our sponsorship of <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/03/24/sponsorship-update/">diversity, inclusion &amp; belonging events</a>.</p>
<h5 id="bias-towards-asynchronous-communication">Bias towards asynchronous communication<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Take initiative to operate <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/">asynchronously</a> whenever possible. This shows care and consideration for those who may not be in the same time zone, are traveling outside of their usual time zone, or are <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/people/#creating-a-more-efficient-day">structuring their day</a> around pressing commitments at home or in their community.</p>
<p>This is demonstrated by communicating recordings of <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/meetings/">meetings</a>, using GitLab Issues and Merge Requests rather than texts, calls, or Slack messages, and being sensitive to local holidays and vacation statuses. Encourage others to default to <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/documentation/">documentation</a> rather than pressuring others to be online outside of their working hours.</p>
<h5 id="embracing-uncomfortable-ideas-and-conversations">Embracing uncomfortable ideas and conversations<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#embracing-uncomfortable-ideas-and-conversations" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Part of embracing diversity is a willingness to embrace often uncomfortable conversations and situations. This concept is also at the core of inclusion and helping to eliminate the problems that are faced by certain GitLab team members who may not be in the majority.</p>
<p>We believe that being willing to embrace discomfort is the path forward to a safe, balanced and inclusive work place for all. Challenge yourself, challenge your own pre-set notions and ideas about different cultures or things you don‚Äôt understand. When we are willing to embrace being uncomfortable, we can focus on actually fixing the issues at hand rather than simply ‚Äúappearing to care‚Äù.</p>
<h5 id="understanding-the-impact-of-microaggressions">Understanding the impact of microaggressions<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#understanding-the-impact-of-microaggressions" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Microaggressions are much more than merely rude or insensitive comments. They can wear people down by slowly chipping away their sense of belonging/safety/inclusion over time. What is a microaggression?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe everyday slights, indignities, put downs and insults that people of color, women, LGBT populations or those who are marginalized experiences in their day-to-day interactions with people.‚Äù -  Derald W. Sue</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At GitLab we believe that everyone is entitled to a safe working space where they can express who they are and participate in conversations without worry of being spoken to in a harmful way, given that we want to encourage everyone to be mindful of what is a microaggression and be mindful of their potential impact.</p>
<h5 id="seek-diverse-perspectives">Seek diverse perspectives<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#seek-diverse-perspectives" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We believe that team members seeking feedback from a diverse group of team members, inside and outside of their group or function, leads to better decisions and a greater sense of team member belonging. For more guidance on how we define Diversity, please refer to <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/inclusion/#gitlabs-definition-of-diversity-inclusion--belonging">GitLab‚Äôs definition of Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Belonging</a>. Feedback from a more heterogenous group often leads to better business outcomes as we incorporate diverse perspectives and uncover unconscious bias.</p>
<p>An example of this operating principle in action showcases the value of actively seeking diverse perspectives. The term ‚ÄúBrag Document‚Äù was used to describe when individuals documented their accomplishments. Documenting accomplishments is critical to team member development. However, team members had the <strong>psychological safety</strong> to raise the question of whether or not the title of the document made some feel uncomfortable. In an effort to seek a <strong>diverse perspective</strong>, a survey was conducted in one of the <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/inclusion/erg-guide/#what-is-not-an-tmrg-at-gitlab">TMRG</a> channels. The poll results showed that 100% of those polled preferred a different title and the title was changed.</p>
<h5 id="make-family-feel-welcome">Make family feel welcome<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#make-family-feel-welcome" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>One of the unique elements to an <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/">all-remote culture</a> is the ability to visit a person‚Äôs home while collaborating. If the tenor of the meeting allows, feel welcome to invite your family members or pets to drop by and greet your colleagues. Be mindful of language and use of profanity to encourage a family-friendly environment.</p>
<h5 id="shift-working-hours-for-a-cause">Shift working hours for a cause<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#shift-working-hours-for-a-cause" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Caregiving, outreach programs, and community service do not conveniently wait for regular business hours to conclude. If there‚Äôs a cause or community effort taking place, feel welcome to work with your manager and shift your working hours to be available during a period where you‚Äôll have the greatest impact for good. For colleagues supporting others during these causes, document everything and strive to post recordings so it‚Äôs easy for them to catch up.</p>
<h5 id="be-a-mentor">Be a mentor<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#be-a-mentor" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>

<h5 id="culture-fit-is-a-bad-excuse">Culture fit is a bad excuse<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#culture-fit-is-a-bad-excuse" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We don‚Äôt hire based on culture or select candidates because we‚Äôd like to have a drink with them. We hire and reward team members based on our shared values as detailed on this page. We want a <strong>values fit</strong>, not a culture fit.
We want cultural diversity instead of cultural conformity. Said differently: <a href="https://twitter.com/Una/status/846808949672366080">‚Äúculture add‚Äù &gt; ‚Äúculture fit‚Äù</a> or ‚Äúhire for culture contribution‚Äù since our <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/mission/#mission">mission is that everyone can contribute</a>.</p>
<h5 id="religion-and-politics-at-work">Religion and politics at work<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#religion-and-politics-at-work" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We generally avoid discussing politics or religion in public forums because it is easy to alienate people that have a minority opinion. This doesn‚Äôt mean we never discuss these topics. Because we value diversity, inclusion and belonging, and want all team members to feel welcome and contribute equally, we encourage free discussion of operational decisions that can move us toward being a more inclusive company. GitLab also publicly supports pro <a href="#diversity-inclusion">diversity, inclusion &amp; belonging</a> activities and events.</p>
<p>There is sometimes a grey area where advocating for diversity and political activities may intersect. Team members should use discretion in grey area communications, because a culture of belonging requires us to be respectful of the broad spectrum of views within our work environment. What does this mean in practice? Please feel empowered to share information that highlights diversity, inclusion and belonging issues and how GitLab and GitLab team members can get involved. In line with our <a href="https://ir.gitlab.com/static-files/7d8c7eb3-cb17-4d68-a607-1b7a1fa1c95d">Code of Business Conduct and Ethics</a>, avoid posting articles that reference specific political figures or parties.</p>
<p>While it is acceptable for individuals to bring up politics and religion in social contexts such as coffee chats and real-life meetups with other coworkers (with the goal to understand and not judge), always be aware of potential sensitivities, exercise your best judgment, and make sure you stay within the boundaries of our <a href="https://ir.gitlab.com/static-files/7d8c7eb3-cb17-4d68-a607-1b7a1fa1c95d">Code of Business Conduct and Ethics</a>.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre a global company where perspectives and local norms may differ from culture to culture. Diversity, inclusion and belonging is about broad inclusion at a worldwide level.

Everyone has the right to feel safe when working for GitLab and/or as a part of the GitLab community.
We do not tolerate abuse, <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/anti-harassment/">harassment</a>, exclusion, discrimination, or retaliation by/of any community members, including our team members.

<h5 id="inclusive-language--pronouns">Inclusive language &amp; pronouns<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#inclusive-language--pronouns" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Use <strong>inclusive</strong> language.
For example, prefer ‚ÄúHi everybody‚Äù or ‚ÄúHi people‚Äù to ‚ÄúHi guys‚Äù, and ‚Äúthey‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhe/she‚Äù. While there are several good guides from folks like <a href="https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/">18f</a>, <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/news/ucalgary-guidelines-updated-communicating-about-gender-and-sexual-diversity">University of Calgary</a>, and <a href="https://open.buffer.com/inclusive-language-tech/">Buffer</a> on using inclusive language, we don‚Äôt keep an exhaustive list.
When new possibly non-inclusive words arise, we prefer to be proactive and look for an alternative.
If your goal is to be inclusive, it is more effective to make a small adjustment in the vocabulary when some people have a problem with it, rather than making a decision to not change it because some people don‚Äôt think it is a problem.
And if you make a mistake (e.g. accidentally using the wrong pronoun or an outdated phrase), acknowledge it, <strong>apologize gracefully and move on</strong>; there is no need to dwell on it, and you can work to avoid making that mistake in the future.
Please also visit our <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/orientation-identity/">Gender and Sexual-orientation Identity Definitions and FAQ</a> page if you have questions around pronouns and other topics related to gender / sexual orientation.</p>
<h5 id="inclusive-interviewing">Inclusive interviewing<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#inclusive-interviewing" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>This is documented on our page about <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/interviewing/#inclusive-interviewing">interviewing</a>.</p>
<h5 id="inclusive-meetings">Inclusive meetings<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#inclusive-meetings" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Be consciously inclusive in <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/meetings/">meetings</a> by giving everyone present an opportunity to talk and present their points of view. This can be especially important in a remote setting.</p>
<p>With internal meetings, consider using an agenda document for questions. For example, with GitLab <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/group-conversations/">Group Conversations</a>, every meeting has a numbered list that GitLab team members can add questions to. During the meeting, questions are answered in turn and discussions noted in the same document. Sometimes, these documents can have so much traffic (during the meeting) such that only a limited number of people can edit the document. In these situations, those who have questions should post on zoom chat and those who can edit the document should help copy the question over to the document. In addition, those who can edit the document should also post in zoom chat to see if anyone has any questions that they could help add to the document so that meeting attendees are more empowered to contribute to the conversation.</p>
<p>Customers are not used to working in this way. To promote inclusion with customers: ask participants for their goals; make sure during demos that you pause for question; leave time for discussion.</p>
<h5 id="inclusive-and-fair-policy-to-regions-with-fewer-employees">Inclusive and fair policy to regions with fewer employees<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#inclusive-and-fair-policy-to-regions-with-fewer-employees" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Being globally distributed has the benefit that someone can cover for you when you are off work. However, population density is not balanced across timezones. Policies should remain fair to those in less dense regions.</p>
<p>For example, the Asia Pacific region covers more timezones but has fewer team members. If we use an algorithm to assign tasks to those in later timezones, all American tasks would fall on the fewer Asia Pacific employees. This can damage belonging and inclusivity and should be avoided.</p>
<p>When planning an event, the organizer should cater for location density differences to maximize participation in all regions.</p>
<h5 id="see-something-say-something">See Something, Say Something<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#see-something-say-something" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>As a globally-dispersed company, we have team members from many different backgrounds and cultures. That means it is important for each of us to use great judgment in being respectful and inclusive of our teammates. At the same time, we may sometimes not fully realize we have said or done something to offend someone. It is important that our teammates hold each other accountable and let them know if they have unintentionally or intentionally done something so they can learn and gain additional understanding of perspectives different from our own. It is also important that our teammates don‚Äôt feel excluded or minimized by the words we use or the things we do. Thus, we all need to speak up when we see something that isn‚Äôt respectful or inclusive.</p>
<h5 id="embracing-neurodiversity">Embracing Neurodiversity<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#embracing-neurodiversity" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p><a href="https://www.neurodiversityhub.org/what-is-neurodiversity">Neurodiversity</a> refers to variations in the human brain regarding learning, attention, sociability, mood, and other mental functions. There are various neurodevelopmental conditions, like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, bipolarity, and other styles of neurodivergent functioning. While neurodivergent individuals often bring <a href="https://adhdatwork.add.org/potential-benefits-of-having-an-adhd-employee/">unique skills and abilities</a> which can be harnessed for a <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage">competitive advantage</a> in many fields (for example, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samcurry/2019/05/13/neurodiversity-a-competitive-advantage-in-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a>), neurodivergent individuals are often discriminated against. Due to non-inclusive hiring practices, they sometimes have trouble making it through traditional hiring processes. Neurodiversity inclusion best practices benefit everyone, and at GitLab, everyone can contribute. The handbook, values, strategy, and interviewing processes must support the ability for everyone to thrive.</p>
<p>At GitLab we embrace Neurodiversity through adopting a variety of different work styles and communication styles, and we lean into <a href="#transparency">transparency</a>, asynchronous as a default working style, and pre-filled meeting agendas. These best practices become even more important when embracing neurodiversity. Providing multiple ways to consume information (written / video / audio) allows everyone to contribute independent of their preferred comprehension style. It is important to ask team members specifically what their preferred communication method is in order to provide them information in a format that is easily consumable for them.</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>brains work differently</strong> and always <a href="#assume-positive-intent">assume positive intent</a>, even if someone behaves in an unexpected way. While it may be an unexpected behavior to you, it may not be unexpected to the individual exhibiting the behavior. That is the beauty and value of diversity, embracing differences and becoming stronger and better as a result.</p>
<p>We also recommend that all team members review the <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-policies/inc-usa/#reasonable-accommodation">Reasonable Accommodation</a> process. A Reasonable Accommodation for a team member could include noise-cancelling headphones, scheduling smaller group session zoom calls, providing very explicit and precise instructions and due-dates when given tasks, or providing a variety of supportive software tools.</p>
<p>The most important thing that managers can do is facilitate an environment in which all team members feel <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/emotional-intelligence/psychological-safety/#what-is-psychological-safety">psychologically safe</a> enough to make requests for <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/inclusion/neurodiversity-resources/#resources-for-team-members-and-managers">what they need</a> in order to do their job.</p>

<p>While the terms equity and equality may sound similar, the implementation of one versus the other can lead to dramatically different outcomes for marginalized people.</p>

<h2 id="iteration">üë£ Iteration<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#iteration" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/iteration#:~:text=%3A%20the%20action%20or%20a%20process,closer%20to%20a%20desired%20result">Merriam-Webster</a> defines iteration as the ‚Äúthe action or a process of iterating or repeating: such as a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result.‚Äù At GitLab, we iterate to do the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/01/04/behind-the-scenes-how-we-built-review-apps/">smallest viable and valuable thing, and get it out quickly for feedback</a>. This thing may be additive (adding something) or subtractive (removing something). If you make suggestions that can be excluded from the first iteration, turn them into a separate issue that you link. While you should have a clear vision of the desired outcome, don‚Äôt write a large plan; only write the first step. Trust that you‚Äôll know better how to proceed after something is released. You‚Äôre doing it right if you‚Äôre slightly embarrassed by the minimal feature set shipped in the first iteration. This value is the one people most underestimate when they join GitLab. The impact both on your work process and on how much you achieve is greater than anticipated. In the beginning, it hurts to make decisions fast and to see that things are changed with less consultation. But frequently, the simplest version turns out to be the best one.</p>
<p>People that join GitLab all say they already practice iteration. But this is the value that is the hardest to understand and adopt. People are trained that if you don‚Äôt deliver a perfect or polished thing, there will be a problem. If you do just one piece of something, you have to come back to it. Doing the whole thing seems more efficient, even though it isn‚Äôt. If the complete picture is not clear, your work might not be perceived as you want it to be perceived. It seems better to make a comprehensive product. They see other GitLab team members being really effective with iteration but don‚Äôt know how to make the transition, and it‚Äôs hard to shake the fear that constant iteration can lead to shipping lower-quality work or a worse product. It is possible to ship a minimally viable product while continuing to adhere to the documented quality standards.</p>
<p>The way to resolve this is to write down only what value you can add with the time you have for this project right now. That might be 5 minutes or 2 hours. Think of what you can complete in that time that would improve the current situation. Iteration can be uncomfortable, even painful. If you‚Äôre doing iteration correctly, it should be. Reverting work back to a previous state is positive, not negative. We‚Äôre quickly getting feedback and learning from it. Making a small change prevented a bigger revert and made it easier to revert.</p>
<p>However, if we take smaller steps and ship smaller, simpler features, we get feedback sooner. Instead of spending time working on the wrong feature or going in the wrong direction, we can ship the smallest product, receive fast feedback, and course correct. People might ask why something was not perfect. In that case, mention that it was an iteration, you spent only ‚Äúx‚Äù amount of time on it, and that the next iteration will contain ‚Äúy‚Äù and be ready on ‚Äúz‚Äù.</p>
<p>Iteration enables <a href="#results">results</a> and <a href="#efficiency">efficiency</a></p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2r0UeZ5p57Y" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p><em>In the <a href="https://youtu.be/2r0UeZ5p57Y">GitLab Unfiltered video</a> embedded above, GitLab CEO and co-founder Sid Sijbrandij shares key operating principles to reinforce iteration in an organization.</em></p>
<h5 id="start-with-a-long-term-vision">Start with a long-term vision<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#start-with-a-long-term-vision" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Iteration involves driving results in pursuit of a long-term vision. While the intermediate goals may change as we iterate, we are unlikely to be successful if we don‚Äôt start with a vision of what we are working toward. Shipping that vision in iterations allows us to learn from customers using it and adjust the vision if needed. Iteration for the sake of iteration can lead to inefficiencies and not deliver desired results.</p>
<h5 id="dont-wait">Don‚Äôt wait<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#dont-wait" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Don‚Äôt wait. When you have something of value like a potential blog post or a small fix, implement it straight away. Right now, everything is fresh in your head and you have the motivation. Inspiration is perishable. Don‚Äôt wait until you have a better version. Don‚Äôt wait until you record a better video. Don‚Äôt wait for an event (like Contribute). Inventory that isn‚Äôt released is a liability since it has to be managed, becomes outdated, and you miss out on the feedback you would have received had you implemented it straight away. When we don‚Äôt wait we signal intent to others that we have a purpose to resolve something.</p>
<h5 id="iterate-toward-global-maximum">Iterate toward global maximum<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#iterate-toward-global-maximum" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>If we are not aware of interdependencies beyond our team and collaborating with others across the organization, we risk deliverables that settle into a ‚Äúlocal maxima‚Äù of quality, richness, and efficiencies. This localization is largely defined by team structure and organizational boundaries. While an iteration can take place within a single team, that team is responsible for identifying inter-dependencies and proactively communicating and aligning with other teams working on related projects. This helps ensure that iterations are not ‚Äúhalf-baked‚Äù and align with work being done across the broader organization.</p>
<h5 id="set-a-due-date">Set a due date<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#set-a-due-date" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We always try to set a due date. If needed, we cut scope.
If we have something planned for a specific date, we make that date. For example we <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/11/21/why-gitlab-uses-a-monthly-release-cycle/">shipped over 133 monthly releases</a>. But every one of them doesn‚Äôt contain all the features we planned.
If we planned an announcement for a certain date, we might announce less or indicate what is still uncertain.
But we set a due date because having something out there builds trust and gives us better feedback.</p>
<h5 id="cleanup-over-sign-off">Cleanup over sign-off<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#cleanup-over-sign-off" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>As discussed in <a href="https://youtu.be/tPTweQlBS54?t=1030">Sid‚Äôs interview on iteration</a>, waiting for approval can slow things down. We can prevent this with automation (e.g. tests of database migration performance) or clean-up after the fact (refactor a Pajamas if something was added that isn‚Äôt coherent), but we try to ensure that people don‚Äôt need to wait for signoff.</p>
<h5 id="start-off-by-impacting-the-fewest-users-possible">Start off by impacting the fewest users possible<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#start-off-by-impacting-the-fewest-users-possible" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>If you do a gradual rollout of your change prefer: few users over many users, internal users (dogfooding) over external ones,  environments you get faster feedback about (SaaS) over low feedback ones (self-managed), etc.</p>
<h5 id="reduce-cycle-time">Reduce cycle time<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#reduce-cycle-time" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Short iterations reduce <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/value-stream-analytics/">our cycle time</a>.</p>
<h5 id="work-as-part-of-the-community">Work as part of the community<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#work-as-part-of-the-community" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Small iterations make it easier to work with the wider community. Their work looks more like our work, and our work is also quicker to receive feedback.</p>
<h5 id="minimal-viable-change-mvc">Minimal Viable Change (MVC)<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#minimal-viable-change-mvc" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We encourage MVCs to be as small as possible. Always look to make the quickest change possible to improve the user‚Äôs outcome. If you validate that the change adds more value than what is there now, then do it. This may be additive (adding something) or subtractive (removing something). No need to wait for something more robust. More information is in the <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#the-minimal-viable-change-mvc">product handbook</a>, but this applies to everything we do in all functions. Specifically for product MVCs, there is additional responsibility to validate with customers that we‚Äôre adding useful functionality without obvious bugs or usability issues.</p>
<h5 id="make-a-proposal">Make a proposal<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#make-a-proposal" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>If you need to decide something as a team, make a concrete proposal instead of calling a meeting to get everyone‚Äôs input. Having a proposal will be a much more effective use of everyone‚Äôs time. Every meeting should be a review of a proposal. We should be <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3033567/brainstorming-doesnt-work-try-this-technique-instead">brainwriting on our own instead of brainstorming out loud</a>. State the underlying problem so that people have enough context to propose reasonable alternatives. The people that receive the proposal should not feel left out and the person making it should not feel bad if a completely different proposal is implemented. Don‚Äôt let your desire to be involved early or to see your solution implemented stand in the way of getting to the best outcome. If you don‚Äôt have a proposal, don‚Äôt let that stop you from highlighting a problem, but please state that you couldn‚Äôt think of a good solution and list any solutions you considered.</p>
<p>By making a proposal you also provide better visibility into the work and the context surrounding it.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://youtu.be/tPTweQlBS54">GitLab Unfiltered video</a>, GitLab CEO and co-founder Sid Sijbrandij converses about iteration in engineering, leveraging proposals to break work into smaller components.</p>
<h5 id="everything-is-in-draft">Everything is in draft<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#everything-is-in-draft" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>At GitLab, we rarely mark any content or proposals as drafts. Everything is always in draft and subject to change. When everything is in draft, contributions from team members as well as the wider community are welcomed. By having everything in draft and <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/effective-communication/#understanding-low-context-communication">assuming others have low context</a>, confusion can be reduced as people have shared access to information.</p>
<h5 id="under-construction">Under construction<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#under-construction" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>As we get more users, they will ask for stability, especially in our UX. We should always optimize for the long term. This means that users will be inconvenienced in the short term, but current and future users will enjoy a better product in the end.</p>
<p>Educating users on the longer-term plan helps create a shared understanding of how a small change will incrementally grow into something more. For example, we could share how a dropdown will evolve into a much more nuanced solution in the future. We can take the following steps to articulate our plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a feedback issue that provides context about the initial MVC (<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221284">example</a>)</li>
<li>Ensure the direction page articulates a long-term plan (<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/#project-management">example</a>)</li>
<li>Announce the MVC in a release post, link to the feedback issue, and link to the direction page (<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/#assign-issues-to-iterations">example</a>)</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="low-level-of-shame">Low level of shame<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#low-level-of-shame" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>When we talked to Nat Friedman, he said: ‚ÄúA low level of shame is intrinsic to your culture.‚Äù This captures the pain we feel by shipping something that isn‚Äôt where we want it to be yet.</p>
<p>GitLab Head of Remote Darren M. adds context on this operating principle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many organizations, you take a risk when you put forth any work that‚Äôs not perfect ‚Äî where you haven‚Äôt spent endless cycles planning for contingencies or counterpoints. Because of this, you‚Äôre incentivized to invest a lot of time and effort into preparing for ‚ÄòWhat if?‚Äô scenarios before any work is presented.</p>
<p>The downside to that is clear. If you do eventually put forth the work, but it needed to be course corrected a long time ago, you‚Äôve now squandered a lot of time that you could have spent improving it via iteration.</p>
<p>Having a low level of shame requires you to combat a natural inclination to conceal work until it‚Äôs perfect, and instead celebrate the small changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="cultural-lens">Cultural lens<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#cultural-lens" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Cultural differences can bring unique challenges and expectations to iteration. For some, expressions like ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect‚Ä¶‚Äù can challenge cultural norms. We encourage you to bring your authentic self and seek shared understanding when iterating. <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#giving-feedback">Giving feedback</a> and ensuring <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/emotional-intelligence/psychological-safety/#what-is-psychological-safety">psychological safety</a> are necessary for every iterative attempt.</p>
<h5 id="focus-on-improvement">Focus on improvement<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#focus-on-improvement" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We believe great companies sound negative because they focus on what they can improve, not only on what is working well.
In every conversation, inside and outside the company, we should ask a question: What do you think we can improve?
This doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt recognize our successes; for example, see our <a href="#say-thanks">Say Thanks</a> value.</p>
<p>We are positive about the future of the company. We are <strong>S</strong>hort <strong>Te</strong>rm <strong>C</strong>ritical <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>L</strong>ong <strong>T</strong>erm <strong>O</strong>ptimistic (<code>STeCALTO</code>, for short).</p>
<h5 id="be-deliberate-about-scale">Be deliberate about scale<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#be-deliberate-about-scale" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>First, optimize for speed and results (and be deliberate about how your change affects other processes/functionality); when it is a success, figure out how to scale it. Great examples are in <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">this article by Paul Graham</a>.</p>
<h5 id="resist-bundling">Resist bundling<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#resist-bundling" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Resist the urge to bundle a series of smaller iterations so team members don‚Äôt see a project as their last (or best) opportunity to contribute. It‚Äôs tempting to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28463789">create encompassing projects or initiatives</a> that roll many smaller projects up. This incarnation of scope creep drives up cost, encourages fewer risks, and incentivizes perfection (via longer cycle times) over progress. When we resist bundling, we reduce the risk that work will be canceled due to scale or scope. By resisting bundling we also reduce the coordination needed because fewer people or teams may be involved.</p>
<h5 id="make-two-way-door-decisions">Make two-way door decisions<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#make-two-way-door-decisions" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Most decisions are easy to reverse. In these cases, the <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/">Directly Responsible Individual</a> should go ahead and make them without approval. Only when you can‚Äôt reverse them should there be a more thorough discussion. By <a href="#embracing-iteration">embracing iteration</a> and making two-way door decisions, we are more efficient and achieve more results.</p>
<h5 id="changing-proposals-isnt-iteration">Changing proposals isn‚Äôt iteration<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#changing-proposals-isnt-iteration" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Changing something without shipping it is a revision, not iteration. Only when the change is rolled out to users can you learn from feedback. When you‚Äôre changing a proposal based on different opinions, you‚Äôre frequently wasting time; it would be better to roll out a small change quickly and get real world feedback. Never call a revision an iteration because it is almost the opposite.</p>
<p>A few challenges have arisen with how we approach iteration. The best example may be the proposal of a two-month release cycle. The argument was that a longer release cycle would buy us time for bug fixes and feature development, but we don‚Äôt believe that is the case. As detailed above, we aim to make the absolute smallest viable and valuable thing possible, and that doing otherwise will only slow us down.</p>
<p>That said, we would love to work on a two-week release cycle, but that should be another conversation.</p>
<h5 id="embracing-iteration">Embracing Iteration<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#embracing-iteration" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>In order to embrace iteration, we should have the attitude that we are trying to achieve as much as possible in a small amount of time; it‚Äôs where we are at the end state of an iteration, that counts. The benefit of iteration is to get feedback from the end-user. Focus on sharing context on the <em>end of the first iteration</em> rather than a <em>hypothetical future state</em> requiring multiple iterations. By embracing iteration we can increase creativity in incremental components.</p>

</div>

<h5 id="make-small-merge-requests">Make small merge requests<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#make-small-merge-requests" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>When you are submitting a merge request for a code change, or a process change in
the handbook, keep it as small as possible. If you are adding a new page to the
handbook, create the new page with a small amount of initial content, get it merged
quickly via <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/">Handbook Usage guidelines</a>, and then add additional sections iteratively with subsequent merge requests.
Similarly, when adding features to GitLab, consider ways to <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#crafting-an-mvc">reduce the scope</a> of the feature before creating the merge request to ensure your merge request is as small as possible.</p>
<h5 id="always-iterate-deliberately">Always iterate deliberately<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#always-iterate-deliberately" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Rapid iteration can get in the way of <a href="#results">results</a> if it‚Äôs not thought out; for example, when adjusting our marketing messaging (where consistency is key), product categories (where we‚Äôve set development plans), <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/structure/#organizational-structure">organizational structure</a> or <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#realignment-of-resources-impacting-multiple-team-members">product scope alignment</a> (where real human stresses and team stability are involved), sales methodologies (where we‚Äôve trained our teams) and this values page (where
we use the values to guide all GitLab team members). In those instances, we add additional review to the approval
process; not to prohibit, but to be more deliberate in our iteration. The change process is documented in the <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/">GitLab Handbook Usage</a> page and takes place via merge request approvals.</p>
<h5 id="see-it-in-action">See it in action<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#see-it-in-action" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>

<p>Iteration is often counterintuitive and difficult to do. To clarify what an iteration is, it helps to see examples of what is not an iteration. Below are 12 examples of things we‚Äôve seen mistaken as iteration, but don‚Äôt meet our definition of iteration.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reducing quality</li>
<li>Avoiding or reducing documentation</li>
<li>Compromising on security</li>
<li>Delivering something that‚Äôs not the recommended path or on by default</li>
<li>Shipping something of no value</li>
<li>An excuse to focus on unimportant items</li>
<li>Changing or lowering goal posts</li>
<li>Revisions you don‚Äôt ship or publish</li>
<li>An excuse to impose unrealistically tight timelines</li>
<li>An excuse to avoid planning</li>
<li>Imposing long hours</li>
<li>Expecting others to fix your work</li>
</ol>
<p>In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW6TWwNZzIQ">GitLab Unfiltered video</a>, GitLab co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij elaborates on each of these 12 things that are not iteration.</p>

<h2 id="transparency">üëÅÔ∏è Transparency<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#transparency" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p>Be open about as many things as possible. By making information public, we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. Use public issue trackers, projects, and repositories when possible. Transparency is not communication. Just because something exists in the handbook or elsewhere doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs been communicated to the people who should understand or acknowledge it. On a personal level, be direct when sharing information, and admit when you‚Äôve made a mistake or were wrong. When something goes wrong, it is a great opportunity to say ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen">kaizen</a> moment here?‚Äù and find a better way without hurt feelings.</p>
<p>Even as a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/10/14/gitlab-inc-takes-the-devops-platform-public/">public company</a>, we know that our value of transparency will be key to our success. This value can be hard to follow at times. You might ask yourself: what should be shared, how much to share, whether or not to speak up but definitely take the time to always opt for maximum transparency by adhering to the operating principles below. Often, company values get diluted as they grow, most likely because they do not write anything down. But we will make sure our values scale with the company. As a <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/being-a-public-company/">public company</a>, we declare everyone in the company as an insider, which allows us to remain transparent internally about our numbers, etc. Everything else that can be transparent will continue to be so.</p>
<p>When there are exceptions, material that is <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/confidentiality-levels/#not-public">not public by default is documented</a>.</p>
<h5 id="public-by-default">Public by default<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#public-by-default" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Everything at GitLab is public by default.
The public process does two things: allows others to benefit from the conversation and acts as a filter. Since there is only a limited amount of time, we prioritize conversations that a wider audience can benefit from.</p>
<p>One example of transparency at GitLab is the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/">public repository of this website</a>
that also contains this <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/">company handbook</a>. Others include the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues">GitLab CE</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues">GitLab EE</a> issue trackers, as well as <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/issues">marketing</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues">infrastructure</a>. Transparency creates awareness for GitLab, allows us to recruit people that care about our values, gets us more and faster feedback from people outside the company, and makes it easier to collaborate with them. It is also about sharing great software, documentation, examples, lessons,
and processes with the <strong>whole community</strong> and the world in the spirit of open source, which we believe creates more value than it captures.</p>
<p>In line with our value of transparency and being public by default, all GitLab team member <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/#user-profile">profiles</a> should be public. Public profiles also enable broader collaboration and efficiencies between teams. To do so, please make sure that the checkbox under the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/#private-profile">Private profile</a> option is unchecked <a href="https://gitlab.com/-/profile">in your profile settings</a>. If you do not feel comfortable with your full name or location on your profile, please change it to what feels appropriate to you as these are displayed even on private profiles.</p>
<p>Because we are public by default and have the <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/">SAFE framework</a> we don‚Äôt need to make cases for why things should be transparent. If something is unSAFE and needs to remain <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/confidentiality-levels/#not-public">not public</a> it can be.</p>
<h5 id="not-public">Not public<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#not-public" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We make information public by default because <a href="#transparency">transparency is one of our values</a>.
However it is <a href="#hierarchy">most important to focus on results</a>.
Therefore, a category of information is <strong>public</strong> unless there is a reason for it not to be. If something is not public, there should be a reference in the handbook that states a confidential decision was taken with a link to our Not Public guidelines, unless legal feels it carries undue risk. We document what is <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/confidentiality-levels/#not-public">not public by default</a> on our communication page.</p>
<p>If you believe something shouldn‚Äôt be public that currently is (or vice versa), then <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#start-with-a-merge-request">make a merge request</a> to the relevant page(s) suggesting the change so that you can collaborate with others and discuss with the <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/">DRI</a>. When content contains information which is <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/confidentiality-levels/#not-public">not public</a> it is recommended to remove the specific sections which are not public, put them on their own page in the internal handbook, and then link out to that with a ‚Äúnot public/internal only‚Äù note. Always share publicly what we can.</p>
<p>When information is not public, it may also be treated as limited access, only shared with certain GitLab roles, teams, or team members due to privacy considerations, contractual obligation, or other reasons that the author or DRI can specify.
Certain kinds of information default to limited access, including details about team members or customers who did not give permission to share the information.</p>
<p>Most companies become non-transparent over time because they don‚Äôt accept any
mistakes. Instead, we should always err on the side of transparency when there
is a choice to be made between caution or inaction, and transparency. If we make
a mistake, we now know what the limits of transparency are for the company and
we should <a href="#not-public">document this</a>. <em>The only exception to this rule would be in the case when there are legal concerns.</em></p>
<p>Because some information is <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/confidentiality-levels/#not-public">not public</a> the public information can be lacking some context. We should be cognizant of that.</p>
<h5 id="directness">Directness<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#directness" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Being direct is about being transparent with each other. We try to channel our inner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Horowitz">Ben Horowitz</a> by being <a href="https://medium.com/@producthunt/ben-horowitz-s-best-startup-advice-7e8c09c8de1b">both straightforward
and kind</a>. Feedback is always about your work and not your person. That doesn‚Äôt mean it will be easy to give or receive it.</p>
<h5 id="articulate-when-you-change-your-mind">Articulate when you change your mind<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#articulate-when-you-change-your-mind" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>If you state one thing, and then change course and support a different direction, point, or outcome, articulate this. It is OK to have your position changed by new data. Articulating that an <em>earlier</em> stance is not your <em>current</em> stance provides clarity to others and encourages data-driven decision making.</p>
<h5 id="surface-issues-constructively">Surface issues constructively<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#surface-issues-constructively" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Be transparent to the right people (up) at the right time (when still actionable). If you make a mistake, don‚Äôt worry; correct it and <strong>proactively</strong> let the affected party, your team, and the CEO know what happened, how you corrected it, and how‚Äîif needed‚Äîyou changed the process to prevent future mistakes.</p>
<h5 id="transparency-is-most-valuable-if-you-continue-to-do-it-when-there-are-costs">Transparency is most valuable if you continue to do it when there are costs<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#transparency-is-most-valuable-if-you-continue-to-do-it-when-there-are-costs" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>We practice transparency even when hiding the facts would be easier. For example, many companies do not give you the real reason why they declined your application because it increases the chance of legal action. We want to only reject people for the right reasons and we want to give them the opportunity to grow by getting this feedback. Therefore, we‚Äôll accept the increased risk of holding ourselves to a high standard of making decisions and do the right thing by telling them what we thought. Other examples are being transparent about <a href="http://disq.us/p/1r9gceh">security incidents</a> and participating in and contributing to Live Broadcasts.</p>
<p>Transparency has costs (distraction, mis-interpretation, etc.) but also great benefits (productivity, hiring, retention, brand awareness, etc). Team members can view more details on these benefits by referencing the ‚ÄúTransparency Benefit Quantification‚Äù slides in Google Drive). We should carefully weigh the tradeoff between costs and benefits, to prevent a knee-jerk reaction to reduce transparency when it has costs.</p>
<h5 id="single-source-of-truth">Single Source of Truth<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#single-source-of-truth" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>By having most company communications and work artifacts be public to the Internet, we have one single source of truth for all GitLab team members, users, customers, and other community members. We don‚Äòt need separate artifacts with different permissions for different people.</p>
<h5 id="findability">Findability<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#findability" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Our transparency value means more than just making information accessible to all. In order to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture">improve performance</a> it‚Äôs important that we not only ensure information is accessible, but also ensure it flows to the correct places and is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Findability">findable</a> by those who need it. Focusing on information flow will ensure you, for example, utilize <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#multimodal-communication">multi-modal communication</a>, or that you keep your <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#updated-ssot-for-stakeholder-collaboration">stakeholders informed of changes</a> by posting links to MRs in Slack.</p>
<h5 id="say-why-not-just-what">Say why, not just what<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#say-why-not-just-what" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Transparent changes have the reasons for the change laid out clearly along with the change itself. This leads to fewer questions later on because people already have some understanding. A change with no public explanation can lead to a lot of extra rounds of questioning, which is less efficient.</p>
<p>This also helps with institutional memory: a year from now when you want to know why a decision was made, or not, the issue or MR that has the decision also shares why the decision was made.
This is related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence">Chesterton‚Äôs fence</a> - it‚Äôs much easier to suggest removing or changing something if you know why it exists in the first place.</p>
<p>Avoid using terms such as ‚Äúindustry standard‚Äù or ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù as they are vague, opaque, and don‚Äôt provide enough context as a reason for a change.</p>
<p>Similarly, merely stating a single value isn‚Äôt a great explanation for why we are making a particular decision. Many things could be considered ‚Äúiteration‚Äù or ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù that don‚Äôt match our definition of those values. Try to link to an operating principle of the value or provide more context, instead of just saying a single value‚Äôs name.</p>
<p>Saying why and not just what enables discussion around topics that may impact more than one value; for instance, when weighing the <a href="#boring-solutions">efficiency of boring solutions</a> with the focus on <a href="#customer-results">customer results</a>. When decisions align with all of our values, they are easy to discuss and decide. When there are multiple values involved, using our <a href="#hierarchy">values hierarchy</a> and <a href="#directness">directly</a> discussing the tradeoffs is easier with more context.</p>
<p>Articulating why also helps people understand how something changed when you <a href="#articulate-when-you-change-your-mind">articulate that you changed your mind</a>.</p>
<p>Saying why does not mean justifying a decision against all other suggestions.
The <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/">DRI</a> is responsible for their decision.
The DRI is not responsible for convincing other people, but they should be able to articulate their reasoning for the change.</p>
<p>When a GitLab Team Member comes across an ask or material (MR, handbook, etc.) that does not provide a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù with sufficient context, the Team Member is responsible for getting the why and, if needed, working with the DRI to ensure that it is adequately documented and communicated to give context to other team members.  In the absence of a why, team members may speculate the why. This is something that can lead to disruption and inefficiency.</p>
<h5 id="reproducibility">Reproducibility<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#reproducibility" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p>Enable everybody involved to come to the same conclusion as you. This not only involves <a href="#say-why-not-just-what">reasoning</a>, but also providing, for example: raw data and not just plots; scripts to automate tasks and not just the work they have done; and documenting steps while analyzing a problem. Do your best to make the line of thinking transparent to others, even <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#making-decisions">if they may disagree</a>.</p>
<h5 id="transparency-competency">Transparency Competency<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#transparency-competency" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h5>
<p><a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/">Competencies</a> are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn.
We demonstrate transparency when we are open with as many things as possible reducing the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier.</p>

<h2 id="why-have-values">Why have values<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#why-have-values" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p>Our values provide guidelines on how to behave and are written to be actionable.
They help us describe the type of behavior that we expect from GitLab team members.
They help us to know how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others.</p>
<p>Values provide a framework for distributed decision making, detailed in GitLab‚Äôs <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/teamops/">TeamOps</a> management philosophy. They allow individuals to determine what to do without asking their manager and they allow teams to make consistent decisions. When teams across the organization reference the same values in their decision making, there is consistency in how decisions are made. This ensures that <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/#culture-at-gitlab">our culture</a> remains driven by our values.</p>
<p>Lastly, values create a <a href="https://conscious.org/what-is-conscious-culture-and-why-do-we-need-it/">conscious culture</a> that is designed to help you prosper and experience exceptional personal growth through work.</p>
<h2 id="five-dysfunctions">Five dysfunctions<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#five-dysfunctions" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p>Our values also help us to prevent the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team#Summary">five dysfunctions</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fear of conflict</strong> Seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate =&gt; <em>prevented by transparency, specifically</em> <a href="#directness">directness</a> <em>and collaboration, specifically</em> <a href="#short-toes">short toes</a></li>
<li><strong>Absence of trust</strong> Unwilling to be vulnerable within the group =&gt; <em>prevented by collaboration, specifically</em> <a href="#kindness">kindness</a></li>
<li><strong>Avoidance of accountability</strong> Ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards =&gt; <em>prevented by results, iteration, and</em> <a href="#transparency">transparency</a></li>
<li><strong>Inattention to results</strong> Focusing on personal success, status, and ego before team success =&gt; <em>prevented by</em> <a href="#results">results</a></li>
<li><strong>Lack of commitment</strong> Feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization =&gt; <em>prevented by transparency, specifically</em> <a href="#directness">directness</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Some dysfunctions are not addressed directly by our values; for example, trust is not one of our values.
Similar to happiness, trust is something that is an outcome, not something you can strive for directly.
We hope that the way we work and our values will instill trust, instead of mandating it from people; trust is earned, not given.</p>
<h2 id="operating-principles">Operating principles<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#operating-principles" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p>Operating principles are behaviors that empower GitLab team members to definitively live out a given value.
They clarify what a given core value means and looks like <em>at GitLab</em>.
Understanding this distinction is critical to thriving at GitLab,
particularly for <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/getting-started/">newer team members</a> who may be familiar with a prior organization‚Äôs interpretation of iteration or collaboration (as examples).</p>
<h6 id="process-for-removing-operating-principles">Process for removing operating principles<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#process-for-removing-operating-principles" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h6>
<p><em>Values are not just things we do, but things that actively drive good behaviour.  When we remove them it doesn‚Äôt mean we stopped believing in it, just that it wasn‚Äôt actively helping to drive behaviour. If we don‚Äôt prune our operating principles, then we will be like every other company: things that make sense but are not leading to a better culture.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>To <strong>remove</strong> an operating principle from the Handbook page, submit your change through a merge request and explain your reasons in the merge request description.</li>

<h6 id="mention-the-specific-value">Mention the specific value<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#mention-the-specific-value" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h6>
<p>Most companies have a list of values. In companies without strong values, folks often use generalizations when they refer to values. For example, ‚Äúnot a value add‚Äù or ‚Äúscored well on values during our interview.‚Äù In companies with strong values, folks name the specific, relevant value as it applies to a given topic or situation. Values are only powerful when they are individually understood and applied by team members.</p>

and they want to provide their feedback and comments.
On the other hand,  it might be challenging for the project DRI to digest and respond to all these inputs.
What should you do in this scenario?</em></p>
<p>Everyone can contribute at GitLab.
We encourage team members to share feedback and leave comments on issues.
Leaving feedback and comments shows that team members care about a topic and about GitLab as a company.
These perspectives may also uncover potential risks and problems in the project.</p>
<p>There shouldn‚Äôt be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9de50APPAg">‚ÄúDon‚Äôt they have their job to do?‚Äù</a> type of response.
Furthermore, we shouldn‚Äôt judge team members who are perceived as being the ‚Äúsqueaky wheel.‚Äù
At GitLab, we <a href="../../teamops/measurement-clarity.md#measure-results-not-hours">measure results, not hours</a>.
As long as a team member is producing required results, they are empowered to decide how to spend their time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as GitLab grows in size, we need to make decisions and the decisions may not be agreed to by everyone.
If a decision or project is sensitive or controversial, and receives large amounts of feedback, it can be challenging for the project DRI to handle.
In these cases, it‚Äôs best to have time-boxed feedback built into timelines.</p>
<p>In a hypothetical example where a DRI needs to decide between red and gold potatoes for a stew, they would create an issue with the following sentiment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôre deciding between red potatoes and gold potatoes to go into the stew. We have to decide by Tuesday 2020-07-14 so that we can get our order to the grocery store on Wednesday 2020-07-15. We‚Äôll be collecting input and feedback until that point. Jane is the DRI and will make the decision on 2020-07-14 with all the information we have at that point. Here is the framework we‚Äôre using for the decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>are there allergies to consider?</li>
<li>cost per pound</li>
<li>team member preferences</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the decision is made, it will be what is going into the stew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This method <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/858#what-happens-next">has shown itself to be effective</a> at soliciting productive feedback that doesn‚Äôt derail a timeline while ensuring team members feel heard.</p>
<h2 id="why-our-values-are-public">Why our values are public<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#why-our-values-are-public" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p>Companies are encouraged to copy and implement GitLab‚Äôs values. They are Creative Commons and can be copied verbatim.</p>
<p>We make our values public for the same <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/hiring/#make-your-strategy-public">reasons</a> we make our <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/okrs/">OKRs</a> (Objectives and Key Results) and <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/strategy/">strategy</a> public. There is great power and efficiency in teams who share company values. Concealing values until <em>after</em> someone is hired into an organization is not a wise strategy.</p>
<p>Not everyone will see our values and feel aligned with them, and that‚Äôs OK. By making values public, it shows respect for the time of job seekers who conduct due diligence on prospective employers. When people who <em>are</em> aligned with GitLab‚Äôs values apply for an <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/">open vacancy</a>, this allows our hiring teams to more efficiently move candidates through the <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/interviewing/">interview process</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://youtu.be/7kMQj4O4ZGU">GitLab Unfiltered interview on values</a>, GitLab co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij offers the following context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Companies may ask you to write a blank check. They‚Äôll say, ‚ÄòCome join our organization, and when you‚Äôre here, you need to subscribe to our values, our way of working, and our strategy. It‚Äôs very essential, and it‚Äôs part of our identity!‚Äô</p>
<p>But these companies don‚Äôt give you the opportunity up front to evaluate it. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me. If it‚Äôs so important that people share your values, have them out there.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="hierarchy">Hierarchy<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#hierarchy" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p>Occasionally, values can contradict each other. For instance, transparency would dictate we publish all security vulnerabilities the moment they are found, but this would jeopardize our users. It‚Äôs useful to keep in mind this hierarchy to resolve confusion about what to do in a specific circumstance, while remaining consistent with our core values.</p>
<p>Think of the hierarchy as a weighting system. Values higher in the hierarchy do not automatically override values lower in the hierarchy. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a change impacts Transparency positively but impacts Efficiency negatively in roughly the same amount, we would move ahead since Transparency is higher in the hierarchy than Efficiency.</li>
<li>If a change has a massive positive impact on Diversity but negatively impacts Iteration, we would move ahead even though Diversity is lower in the hierarchy than Iteration because the overall impact is more positive than negative.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/values.svg" alt="Values"></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://youtu.be/7kMQj4O4ZGU">GitLab Unfiltered interview on values</a>, GitLab co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij offers the following context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs an attempt to relieve at least some of the tension. It‚Äôs not absolute. If you think of values as binary, that‚Äôs not going to work. There will always be interpretation, and there‚Äôs always magnitude to consider.</p>
<p>We made a hierarchy so that it‚Äôs clear, in the end, the result matters most. For instance, we‚Äôre not going to be transparent for the sake of being transparent. We‚Äôre not radical in our transparency. We do it because we think it will lead to better outcomes.</p>
<p>Those hierarchies are really important. They won‚Äôt preempt every debate, but it helps.</p>

<p>Regularly conduct a values exercise at the <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/offsite/">e-group offsite</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important moments to reinforce our values are decisions which affect individual team members most: hiring, promotions, and bonuses, which is why every promotion document at GitLab is shared with the entire company and uses the values as its core structure.</p>
<p>In negative feedback, we should be specific about what the problem is. For example, saying someone is ‚Äú<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/how-corporate-values-get-hijacked-and-misused">not living the values</a>‚Äù isn‚Äôt helpful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your values are what you hire for, what you praise people for, and what you promote them for. By definition, what you do in those instances <em>are</em> your values. It‚Äôs not what you say they are. Values should be explicitly part of our <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/">hiring</a> process, our job profiles, and our <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/360-feedback/">review process</a>.</p>
<p>When we give <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/incentives/#discretionary-bonuses">bonuses</a> and <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/">promotions</a>, they are always linked to values. That‚Äôs the crucial thing. If you reinforce them there, that‚Äôs the most powerful thing you can do. ‚Äî <em>Sid Sijbrandij, GitLab co-founder and CEO</em></p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-if-values-arent-being-lived-out">What to do if values aren‚Äôt being lived out<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#what-to-do-if-values-arent-being-lived-out" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p>Value erosion can occur when indifference and apathy are tolerated. It can also occur when individuals justify undesired behaviors by interpreting values as ‚Äúme values‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcompany values.‚Äù For example, a team member may speak to the importance of personal efficiency in order to justify not collaborating professionally with peers. This is not what we expect from team members in terms of efficiency and collaboration.</p>
<p>If you feel that values are not being lived out in a given scenario, speak up and ask for context in a respectful manner. Navigating value conflicts starts with <a href="#assume-positive-intent">assuming positive intent</a> from other team members. Offer links to relevant values and/or operating principles when discussing the issue. If there is confusion or disagreement about the interpretation of a value, please surface the discussion in GitLab‚Äôs <code>#values</code> Slack channel (for GitLab team members) or @-mentioning  <a href="https://twitter.com/gitlab">@gitlab</a> on Twitter (for those who do not work at GitLab).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://youtu.be/7kMQj4O4ZGU">GitLab Unfiltered interview on values</a>, GitLab co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij offers the following context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost every time we face a hard decision at GitLab, it‚Äôs because values are in conflict. It‚Äôs not binary logic. It requires conversation, and sometimes there is no obvious answer. We can only achieve resolution by respectfully talking with each other and trusting the DRI to make the ultimate decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="permission-to-play">Permission to play<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#permission-to-play" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p>From our values we excluded some behaviors that are obvious; we call them our <em>permission to play</em> behavior:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be truthful and honest.</li>
<li>Be dependable and reliable.</li>
<li>Try to keep promises. If you might not keep a promise, proactively communicate as soon as you suspect it.</li>
<li>Be deserving of the trust of our team members, users and customers.</li>
<li>Be committed to the success of the whole organization.</li>
<li>Act in the best interest of the company, our team members, our customers, users, and investors.</li>
<li>Make the best decisions for GitLab.</li>
<li>Act in accordance with the law.</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt show favoritism as <a href="https://www.employmentlawfirms.com/resources/employment/discrimination/laws-preventing-favoritism-in-the-workplace">it breeds resentment, destroys employee morale, and creates disincentives for good performance</a>. Seek out ways to be fair to everyone.</li>

<h2 id="playing-politics-is-counter-to-gitlab-values">Playing politics is counter to GitLab values<a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#playing-politics-is-counter-to-gitlab-values" aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2>
<p>We don‚Äôt want people to play politics at GitLab.</p>
<p>An example of politics is people discussing a proposal and being overly focused on whose proposal it is.
This is a manifestation of the <a href="https://twitter.com/g_s_bhogal/status/1225561210139049984?">Belief Bias</a>, where we judge an argument‚Äôs strength not by how strongly it supports the conclusion but by how strongly <em>we</em> support the conclusion.
Proposals should be weighed on their merits and not on who proposed them.
Another example is people being promoted based on others liking them or having a lot of alliances. We want people to be promoted based on their results. We value collaboration, but that‚Äôs different from being promoted just because people like you.</p>
<p>Below are some attributes of political and non-political work environments. GitLab plans to maintain a non-political one.</p>
